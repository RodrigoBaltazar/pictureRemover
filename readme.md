## PictureRemover


## Getting Started

Just run the script after you make the changes in the file of the path and filename you want to remove.

```
In my case I have to delete around 1000 pictures in a folder, the pictures names were the same, execept for the last witch was the resolution of the picture.

I have to modify the path name for the folder I want to run the script.

Change the variable retirar name for the last letters I want to delete.
